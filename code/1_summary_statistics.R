Rough sketch:

  For geographic integration and summary statistics (Eseza's focus):

wwtp_jurisdiction - State/territory for regional comparisons
county_names and county_fips - For county-level analysis
key_plot_id - To track specific sewersheds consistently
sample_location - To distinguish between treatment plant and upstream samples
population_served - To contextualize the impact on different population sizes
