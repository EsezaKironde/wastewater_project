# Introduction

Wastewater surveillance has emerged as a critical epidemiological tool for tracking infectious disease spread, particularly during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. This analysis of the National Wastewater Surveillance System (NWSS) dataset provides a comprehensive examination of COVID-19 viral concentrations across different geographic regions. By analyzing SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in wastewater, we offer an innovative approach to monitoring community viral prevalence that complements traditional clinical testing methods.

# Data
Our research utilizes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) wastewater surveillance dataset, capturing a comprehensive time history of SARS-CoV-2 concentrations as of March 7, 2025. The dataset provides a unique perspective on viral transmission by analyzing genetic material found in wastewater treatment plants and upstream collection sites.

## Descriptive Analysis

```{r, summary-stats}
#read in the object we outputted
table_one <- readRDS(
  file = here::here("output/table_one.rds")
)

#print object
#table_one
knitr::kable(table_one, caption = "Table 1: Summary Statistics of CDC wastewater in Fulton County")
```




## Time series plot

This section presents a temporal analysis of SARS-CoV-2 viral concentrations in **Fulton County, Georgia**. The time-series plot below visualizes the 15-day average viral concentration (`ptc_15d`) over time, overlaid with a 7-day rolling average to reveal smoothed trends. Red dots indicate local peaks in viral load, potentially signaling waves of infection. A monthly summary table is included to highlight changes in average and maximum concentration over time.

The bar chart shows monthly average SARS-CoV-2 concentration changes in wastewater for Fulton County, Georgia from May 2022 through April 2025. The data reveals fluctuations with several patterns: June 2022 had the highest increase (32.2%), while several months showed moderate increases (March 2023 at 15.2%, April 2024 at 15%). The data also shows multiple periods of decline, particularly in July 2022 (-7.4%) and August 2024 (-6.1%). Overall, the chart shows the cyclical nature of viral concentration in wastewater over this three-year period, with alternating periods of increase and decrease.
